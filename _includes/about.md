Async meets twice a month in Brighton & Hove, UK, to learn, discuss and play
with JavaScript and related technologies.

We host talks, hack nights, show n' tells and community events. Sessions are
free to attend and are held at The Skiff, a co-working space in the centre of
Brighton. Please sign up to each event you want to attend.

For most sessions, doors open at 7.15pm, the presentation begins at 7.45pm,
we end around 9.30pm and continue nearby for an evening social.
