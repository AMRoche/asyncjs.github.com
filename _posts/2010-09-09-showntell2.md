<a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/6698333">Add yourself to the event on Upcoming</a>

<strong>Have you got a little something to share?</strong> Either something cool that you've seen, or a pet project of your own? <strong>Come and tell us all about it, in 4 minutes</strong> (+ 3 mins for questions).

Perhaps we'll have a look at some of the highlights from the <a href="http://js1k.com">1KB JavaScript competition</a>.
We've run a <a href="http://asyncjs.com/showntell/">Show n' Tell before</a> - you may want to see what the people demoed there.

Let us know in the comments below if there's something you'd like to show, or if you have any questions.
